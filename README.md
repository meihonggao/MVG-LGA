# MVG-LGA: Multi-view graph neural network based on attention mechanism for uncovering lncRNA-related protein coding genes
> If you have any questions in using the program, please feel free to contact us by email: meihonggao@mail.nwpu.edu.cn.

## Requirements
MVG-LGA is tested in the conda environment. It is recommended that users test the program in this way. Of course, they can also execute the program in a familiar environment. Note: Before using MVG-LGA, users first need to prepare the following softwares in the execution environment：
  * Python 3.6.2
  * PyTrorch 1.9.1
  * NumPy 1.19.2
  * Scipy 1.5.2
  * scikit-learn 0.24.1

## Code
This directory stores the python code of the model
  * main_gpu.py
  >It is used to compute the performance of the model for lncRNA-PCG association prediction
  * models.py
  >It is used to define the model.
  * layers.py
  >It is used to define GAT and GCN layer.
  * utils.py
  >It is used to define the functions that need to be used in the model.

## Usage
Here, we provide the usage of MVG-LGA on three datasets. Note: Go to the /MVG-LGA/Code/ directory before using this model.
### Usage on NPInter dataset
  * Please run the following python command：```python main_cpu.py```
